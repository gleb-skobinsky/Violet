/**
 * Represents the layer underneath the press ripple, that displays an overlay for states such as
 * [DragInteraction.Start].
 *
 * Typically, there should be both an 'incoming' and an 'outgoing' layer, so that when transitioning
 * between two states, the incoming of the new state, and the outgoing of the old state can be
 * displayed. However, because:
 *
 * a) the duration of these outgoing transitions are so short (mostly 15ms, which is less than 1
 * frame at 60fps), and hence are barely noticeable if they happen at the same time as an incoming
 * transition b) two layers cause a lot of extra work, and related performance concerns
 *
 * We skip managing two layers, and instead only show one layer. The details for the
 * [AnimationSpec]s used are as follows:
 *
 * No state -> a state = incoming transition for the new state A state -> a different state =
 * incoming transition for the new state A state -> no state = outgoing transition for the old state
 *
 * @see incomingStateLayerAnimationSpecFor
 * @see outgoingStateLayerAnimationSpecFor
